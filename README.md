# Welcome! üñêÔ∏è 
Thanks for stopping by my GitHub account!

## About Me
I am currently studying economics (mostly econometrics) and computer science at Simon Fraser University. I‚Äôve recently been spending most of my free time tinkering with microcontrollers & looking into robotics. 

## üî® Work in progress
-  [Controllable FPV plane using RP2040 (Pi Pico) & ExpressLRS receiver](https://github.com/haydenmai/pico-plane.git)
    - Implementing electronic speed controller (ESC), FPV Camera, CRSF protocol handling.
    - Multicore architecture:
        - One core to receive control data & handle telemetry data.
        - One core processes the data to control servos & ESC.
    - The plane 3D model we are using is the [Micro Sportcam](https://www.3daeroventures.com/microsportcam) (subject to change).

## üìå My Completed Projects
Here are some cool projects I've completed so far from most recent to oldest:
-  [Bird Species Image Classifier](https://github.com/haydenmai/cmpt310-project)
    - Used a pre-trained ResNet-18 CNN model, modifying the final layer to 200 species of birds from CUB-200-2011.
    - Performed descriptive statistics of the dataset & visualized convolution layers (filter output results & grad-CAM).
-  [Vending Machine with RFID](https://github.com/haydenmai/cmpt433-project.git)
    - Fully 3D printed vending machine towers (up to 9 'slots') with the BeagleY-AI. Payment system is supported by a RFID module & verified using a locally hosted server on a separate computer. 
-  Effects of Self-perception on Health
    - An econometrics paper written for ECON 435: Econometrics Method. This paper explores the possible causal effect of self-perceived health on actual health and behaviours. 
-  [Vancouver Crime Rate Analysis & Modelling](https://github.com/haydenmai/van-crime-census)
-  [Google Data Analytic Capstone Project](https://github.com/haydenmai/Google-Data-Analytics-Project)
-  [Card Guessing Probability Calculator/Game](https://github.com/haydenmai/Card-Probability-Calculator)
