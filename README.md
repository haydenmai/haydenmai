## About
I am Hayden, a student studying economics and computer science at Simon Fraser University. 
- **Economics**: Econometrics & data science, involving policy evaluation & forecasting.
- **Computer Science**: Embedded systems, machine learning, data processing.

I often keep myself busy with microcontrollers & robotics related things such as simulation and data filter and estimation. 

## Ongoing
- [**PacerBot, an assistant for runners while running**](https://github.com/themchandra/PacerBot)
	- Developing a robust UART communication line between Raspberry Pi and STM32.

-  [**FPV plane using RP2040 (Pi Pico) & ExpressLRS receiver**](https://github.com/haydenmai/pico-plane.git)
	- Implemented CRSF protocol handling, flight data & control logic. 
    - Multicore architecture:
        - One core to receive control data & handle CRSF payloads.
        - One core processes the data to control motor and servos.
    - The plane 3D model we are using is the [Micro Sportcam](https://www.3daeroventures.com/microsportcam) (subject to change).

## Completed Projects
Here are some projects I've completed so far from most recent to oldest:
-  [**Bird Species Image Classifier**](https://github.com/haydenmai/cmpt310-project)
    - Used a pre-trained ResNet-18 CNN model, modifying the final layer to 200 species of birds from CUB-200-2011.
    - Performed descriptive statistics of the dataset & visualized convolution layers (filter output results & grad-CAM).

-  [**Vending Machine with RFID**](https://github.com/haydenmai/cmpt433-project)
    - Fully 3D printed vending machine towers (up to 9 'slots') with the BeagleY-AI. Payment system is supported by a RFID module & verified using a locally hosted server on a separate computer. 

-  **Effects of Self-perception on Health**
    - An econometrics paper written for ECON 435: Econometric Methods. This paper explores the possible causal effect of self-perceived health on actual health and behaviours. 

-  [**Vancouver Crime Rate Analysis & Modelling**](https://github.com/haydenmai/van-crime-census)
	- Merged various municipal crime and census datasets using geospatial joins and Python (Pandas, GeoPandas).
	- Built and maintained analysis pipelines for prediction, identifying key socioeconomic factors for local crime rate via visualization (Matplotlib) and statistical models (Scikit-learn).
