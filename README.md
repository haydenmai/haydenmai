# Welcome! 🖐️ 
Thanks for visitng my GitHub!

I am currently a student focusing on Economic Data Analysis at Simon Fraser University. Usually, my semester mainly consists of economics, computer science, and often statistics, so I find it to be very refreshing to study every semester!

## 📌 My Completed Projects
So far, there are not a lot of projects. However, I have many ideas in the works!

-  [Google Data Analytic Capstone Project](https://github.com/haydenmai/Google-Data-Analytics-Project)
-  [Card Guessing Game](https://github.com/haydenmai/Card-Probability-Calculator)

## 🔍 My Current/Planned Projects
- A simulation of a small economy based on probability and economics
- A hands on statistical analysis of determinants of income (transportation, language, housing) from the Canadian Census.

## 📖 What I'm learning
### At School:
- **ECON 335**: Cause and Effect in Economic Data
- **CMPT 225**: Data Structures and Programming
- **STAT 271**: Probability and Statistics for Computing Science 

### Outside:

With all the knowledge I've obtained during school, I found that they are often disconnected and hard to apply. So I am finding courses online that could help me convert this knowledge into practical skills:
- I am currently using [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) to learn Pandas, Time Series Modelling, etc.
