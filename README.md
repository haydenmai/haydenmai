# Welcome! üñêÔ∏è 
Thanks for stopping by my GitHub account!

## About Me
I am currently studying economics (mostly econometrics) and computer science at Simon Fraser University. I‚Äôve recently been spending most of my free time tinkering with microcontrollers, and in the process, I‚Äôm learning new topics in computer systems.

## üî® Work in progress
-  [Controllable plane using RP2040 (Pi Pico) & ExpressLRS receiver](https://github.com/haydenmai/pico-plane.git)
    - Implementing CRSF protocol, electronic speed controller (ESC), and MicroSD card module for IMU data via SPI.
    - The plane 3D model we are using is the [Micro Sportcam](https://www.3daeroventures.com/microsportcam) (subject to change).

## üìå My Completed Projects
Here are some cool projects I've completed so far from most recent to oldest:

-  [Vending Machine with RFID](https://github.com/haydenmai/cmpt433-project.git)
    - Fully 3D printed vending machine towers (up to 9 'slots') with the BeagleY-AI. Payment system is supported by a RFID module & verified using a locally hosted server on a separate computer. 
-  Effects of Self-perception on Health
    - An econometrics paper written for ECON 435: Econometrics Method. This paper explores the possible causal effect of self-perceived health on actual health and behaviours. 
-  [Vancouver Crime Rate Analysis & Modelling](https://github.com/haydenmai/van-crime-census)
-  [Google Data Analytic Capstone Project](https://github.com/haydenmai/Google-Data-Analytics-Project)
-  [Card Guessing Probability Calculator/Game](https://github.com/haydenmai/Card-Probability-Calculator)
