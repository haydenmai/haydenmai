Thanks for visitng my GitHub!

I am currently a student focusing on economics and computer science at Simon Fraser University. Usually, my semester mainly consists of economics, computer science, and often statistics. With a wide range of topics I can choose from, I find it to be very refreshing to study new and old ideas every semester!

## 📌 My Completed Projects
Here are some cool project I've completed so far from most recent to oldest:
